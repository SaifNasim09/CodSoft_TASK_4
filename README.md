Project: Currency Converter

Project Overview:

1.A Java-based application that converts a given amount from one currency to another.
2.Uses predefined exchange rates or real-time rates (it API integration is added).
3.Designed to be simple, interactive and user friendly.

Key Features:

1. Currency Selection

*Allows the user to choose a base currency.
*Allows selection of a target currency to which the amount will be converted.
*Supports multiple global currencies (USD, INR, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.).

2. Fetching Currency Rates:
*Can use fixed/manual exchange rates (offline version).
*Or can fetch real-time exchange rates using an external API.
*Ensures accurate conversion based on current market values.

3. User Input (Amount Entry):

*Takes numeric input from the user.
*Accepts any amount (integer or decimal).
*Validates the input to avoid errors.

4. Currency Conversion Logic:

*Converts the input amount from the base currency into the target currency.
*Uses a mathematical formula
*Convert base amount standard reference (usually USD)
*Convert reference target currency
*Ensures precise calculation.

5. Displaying Output:

*Shows the converted amount clearly.
*Displays the final result along with the currency code (e.g., INR, USD).
*Helps the user understand the value in the target currency.

Project Outcomes:

1.Understands how currency conversion works.

2.Gains experience in:

*User input handling
*Data structures (maps for rates)
*API calls (HttpURLConnection)
*JSON parsing

3.Builds a practical, real-world Java application.
